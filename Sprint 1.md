## User Stories:
- Created 25 user stories spanning the features/user requirements of the UFShopEase platform. 
- These user stories define key functionalities such as user authentication, account management, and restaurant/store listing.
- More user stories will be added in future sprints based on scope expansion and resource availability. 
- These user stories can be found under the issues tab with the label [userstories](https://github.com/Deepika-muchukota/SE-Project/issues) in this repository.

## Sprint Planning:
- Cards created for each user story, with subtasks breaking down implementation. 
- Conducted planning and refinement sessions to categorize these tasks using labels like backend, api, frontend, database, etc.
- Developers picked up tasks based on their expertise in an agile fashion.
- Each task was assigned difficulty points for effort estimation.
- Tasks were moved through the To Do → In Progress → Completed workflow.

## Development:
### BackEnd:
- Set up GoLang with PostgreSQL for database management.
- Established DB Connection and API routing using Gorm and Gin frameworks.
- Implemented core CRUD APIs including Signup, Signin, EditUser, FetchUser, and DeleteUser functionalities.

- Developed basic UI layout for restaurant selection.

## Testing:
### BackEnd:

### FrontEnd:

## Pending/In-Progress Work:
